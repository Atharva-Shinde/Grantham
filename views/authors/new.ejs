<!-- The 'action' attribute specifies where to send the form-data when a form is submitted. -->
<!-- this 'post' method is responsible to direct the page to /authors and give author created message, bc we created a router.post method inside authors.js -->
<form action="/authors" method="POST">
    <%- include('_form_field.ejs')%>
    <a href="/authors">Cancel</a>
